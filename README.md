The following project uses react to pull data from an API. It reads in the cities and the zipcodes.  
The user can either search by city name or zipcode.  
If they search by city name --> It provides them with all the zipcodes for that city.  
If they search by zipcode --> It provides them with the city, the coordinates, and the estimated population.  

The program works by detecting when the entry in the search field has changed. Once it has, it fetches data from
the API that corresponds with the search and produces the results in a div container.

The following is a zipcode search:
